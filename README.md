# Work In Progress

### PROJECT SCOPE

freeCodeCamp project *"Build a Technical Documentation Page"* which has to meet specific requirements.

* This is my first webpage using CSS Grid. 
* The biggest challenge was to make the navigation fixed without ruining the layout but the solution was found.
* The right sidebar was added only to fill the space for larger screens. 
* I followed the Mobile-first approach to design.
* Practiced a lot adding code in the html
* Used the &lt;details open&gt; element in the Introduction section.
* It started as a boring documentation project but it was fun and I learnt a lot!<br>I have to to make some adjustment so that the logo and heading sections are also fixed at the top<br> for larger screens.
